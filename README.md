## 🧩 Architecture Overview

ShopEase is built following **Clean Architecture** and the **MVVM** pattern for better code organization and scalability:

- **Presentation Layer:** UI built using **Jetpack Compose**, managed with **ViewModel**  
- **Domain Layer:** Contains app logic and **Use Cases**  
- **Data Layer:** Handles data from **Retrofit (API)** and **Room (Local Database)**  

This separation ensures the app is **maintainable**, **testable**, and **extensible**.
